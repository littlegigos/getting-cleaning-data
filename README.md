# Getting and Cleaning Data

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

1. Download zip source and R file  into a folder on your local drive
2. Unzip UCI HAR Dataset into  Unzip UCI HAR Dataset folder into ypur working direcory.
3. Run source("run_analysis.R"), then there will be created a new file Tiny.txt in your working directory.
